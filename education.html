                <p>My journey in Industrial Engineering really took shape at Pitt's Swanson School of Engineering. I combined my IE major with a Computer Science minor, which gave me a unique perspective on how technology can enhance industrial processes. One of my proudest moments was when our team won 2nd place in the department's senior project competition.</p>
                
                <p>Key areas I explored:</p>
