            <p class="role">Part-time Logistics Assistant</p>
            <p class="exp-description">
                At Alstom's West Mifflin facility, I worked on optimizing the logistics flow for airport rail system production. 
                Using Spiral Layout Planning and Lean methodologies, we achieved significant improvements in material handling 
                and space utilization. The project was particularly interesting as it combined theoretical optimization 
                techniques with practical industrial constraints.
